# Setup
```bash
conda env create -n graph_partition -f environment.yml
```

# Running HEP
```bash
python hep.py <graph_file.el> <num_partitions>
```

Will emit the following files
- `.new.el`: partitioned graph with duplicate nodes (nodes in the same partition are contiguous)
- `.partition.el`: directed edge from duplicate node to original node
- `.order`: the number of nodes in each partition
